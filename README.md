# Godot Spawner
## Spawner for 3D Scenes


Attached to the root node of any scene, this scripts allows you to spawn groups of prefab scenes like trees, roocks or any other 3d model you choose.


## Features

- Allows multiple groups of multiple prefabs to instantiate
- Randomize scale and rotation for every instance
- Allows set altitude range for spawning each group


## Features pending

- Allow creating colliders during the process
- Create chunk to optimize visualization
- Better solution to avoid blocking editor while running the script


## Assets

I'm using assets from Quaternius which I adapted to work better on Godot
