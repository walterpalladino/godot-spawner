# Godot Spawner
## Spawner for 3D Scenes


Attached to the root node of any scene, this scripts allows you to spawn groups of prefab scenes like trees, roocks or any other 3d model you choose.


## Features

- Multiple groups of multiple prefabs to instantiate
- Enable / Disable groups
- Set altitude range for spawning each group
- Groups will be placed only on matching layers. Usually, the same layer used by the terrain
- Randomize scale and rotation for every prefab instance
- Allow filler areas to avoid prefab placement or manual placement of other models
- Creating colliders during the process


## Features pending

- Create chunk to optimize visualization
- Better solution to avoid blocking editor while running the script


## Assets

I'm using assets from Quaternius which I adapted to work better on Godot
